## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I've been continuing developing my JavaScript skills, as well as HTML and CSS. I know that there is a far better solution than what I have done here but I'm proud that I even got to finish this seemingly easy interface but was a hard challenge to do.

I will continue to write better and maybe readable code in the future but for now I need to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of all the tools that I have used in this project.
